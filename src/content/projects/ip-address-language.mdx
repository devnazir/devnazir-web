<Section title="Background">
  <p>
    When I was learning Go, I challenged myself to make a programming language that could be written
    using only numbers and dots. I wanted to see if I could make a programming language that was
    easy to understand and fun to use. So, I made this.

<Section title="Example Code">
  <p class="mb-4">Here's an example of the code that can be written in this language:</p>
  <CodeBlock>
    {`
    105.102 120 60 53 123
      101.99.104.111 34 120 105.115 103.114.101.97.116.101.114 116.104.97.110 53 34
    125 101.108.115.101 105.102 120 61.61 53 123
      101.99.104.111 34 120 105.115 101.113.117.97.108 116.111 53 34
    125 101.108.115.101 123
      101.99.104.111 34 120 105.115 108.101.115.115 116.104.97.110 53 34
    125
  `}
  </CodeBlock>

  <p class="mb-4">
    is translated to:
  </p>
  <CodeBlock>
    {`
    if x < 5 {
        echo "x is greater than 5"
    } else if x == 5 {
        echo "x is equal to 5"
    } else {
        echo "x is less than 5"
    }
    `}
